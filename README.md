Photoshop Etiquette
===========

## FILE ORGANIZATION
- Consolidate your PSD files. Only use a minimal number of PSDs.
- Name files appropriately. 
For example: "ClientName_desktop.psd", "ClientName_tablet.psd" and "ClientName_mobile.psd". 
Not: "newest.psd", "LATEST.psd" or "Final_v2.psd".
- Store all assets relative to PSD. Keep stock-photos/icons/fonts  in a folder close to the PSD, preferably in a folder labeled "assets".
- Make a separate template for all global UI elements. Making a PSD strictly for user interface treatments (buttons, forms, etc.) with all different states (:hover, :active, errors) helps during the development phase.
- Make a separate template or style guide for setting typography (font families, sizes, colours, etc.). This helps making sure that the typography stays consisted throughout the project.


## SETTING TYPOGRAPHY
- Set font size in pixels, not points.
- Use whole pixel values. Refrain from resizing text with the Free Transform tool and give it a whole number value instead.


## IMAGE ELEMENTS
- Keep logos, icons, buttons and other graphical elements as vector smart objects. This helps when resizing is needed.
